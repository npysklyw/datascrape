# datascrape

Project in which we will get a playlist of youtube videos, and send the subtitle and chapter data to an csv format in order to train on.

First run  ```npm install``` in this directory to get the node modules used.

To run scraper.js use ```node scraper.js```
  
In the scrape.js file you should be able to add playlistId string so you can get subtitle and chapter data for all videos in a playlist of these exist.
